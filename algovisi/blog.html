        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In the world of computer science, algorithms are the backbone of problem-solving. However, understanding how these algorithms work can often be challenging. This blog aims to explore the fascinating realm of algorithm visualization, a powerful tool that helps demystify complex concepts through visual representation.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>What is Algorithm Visualization?</h2>
        <p>Algorithm visualization is the graphical representation of algorithms in action. By visualizing the steps and processes involved in an algorithm, learners can gain a deeper understanding of how algorithms function, their efficiency, and their applications. This approach not only enhances comprehension but also makes learning more engaging.</p>

        <h2>Why Visualize Algorithms?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Understanding:</strong> Visual aids help break down complex processes into manageable parts, making it easier to grasp the underlying principles.</li>
            <li><strong>Interactive Learning:</strong> Many visualization tools allow users to interact with algorithms, providing a hands-on learning experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Immediate Feedback:</strong> Observing the effects of changes in real-time helps learners understand the impact of different variables on algorithm performance.</li>
        </ul>
